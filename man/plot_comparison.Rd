\title{Plot Comparisons}
\usage{
plot_comparison(p1, p2, caption1, caption2, nmi2, nmi1, title)
}
\arguments{
\item{p1}{An object representing the first network analysis result (e.g., the initial EGA object before reduction).}

\item{p2}{An object representing the second network analysis result (e.g., the final EGA object after reduction).}

\item{caption1}{A character string to be used as a caption or title for the first network (e.g., "Before AI-GENIE Network").}

\item{caption2}{A character string for the second network (e.g., "After AI-GENIE Network").}

\item{nmi2}{A numeric value representing the NMI of the second network.}

\item{nmi1}{A numeric value representing the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) of the first network.}

\item{title}{A character string specifying the title of the plot.}
}
\value{
A plot object that visually compares the two network structures. The plot will typically display
the two networks (either side-by-side or in an overlaid manner) with the provided captions and NMI values.
The exact type of the plot object (e.g., a \code{ggplot} object or a base R plot) depends on the implementation.
}
\description{
Generates a comparative plot of two network analysis results, typically representing the item network
before and after AI-GENIE reduction. The plot includes provided captions, displays NMI values for each network,
and incorporates a scale title to contextualize the comparison. The layout may be adjusted based on the
\code{ident} parameter.
