\title{Generate Embeddings Using HuggingFace Models (Enhanced)}
\usage{
embed_items_huggingface_enhanced(
  embedding.model,
  hf.token = NULL,
  items,
  silently = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{embedding.model}{Character string specifying the HuggingFace model.
Supported models include:
\itemize{
\item BAAI/bge series (API-compatible)
\item sentence-transformers models (via library)
\item Google EmbeddingGemma models (requires authentication)
\item GTE series models (via library)
}}

\item{hf.token}{Optional character string. HuggingFace API token for
authentication and increased rate limits.}

\item{items}{Data frame containing the items to embed. Must have:
\itemize{
\item \code{statement}: Character vector of text to embed
\item \code{ID}: Unique identifiers for each statement
}}

\item{silently}{Logical. If FALSE, displays progress messages.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{embeddings}: Numeric matrix where columns are items
and rows are embedding dimensions. NULL if embedding fails.
\item \code{success}: Logical indicating whether embedding was successful.
}
}
\description{
Generates embeddings for text items using HuggingFace models with automatic
fallback to sentence-transformers library for models not supported by the
Inference API. Handles gated models, authentication, and various model types.
}
\details{
The function automatically determines the best approach for each model:
\enumerate{
\item Tries the Inference API for known compatible models
\item Falls back to sentence-transformers library for unsupported models
\item Handles authentication for gated models
\item Uses memory-efficient loading for large models
}
}
