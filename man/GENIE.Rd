\item{\code{overall}}{Results for all items considered agnostic of item type, containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{final_NMI}}{Final normalized mutual information after all reduction steps}
\item{\code{initial_NMI}}{Initial NMI of the pre-reduced, full item pool}
\item{\code{embeddings}}{List with \code{full} (full embedding matrix of reduced items),
\code{sparse} (sparsified embeddings of reduced items), \code{selected} (string specifying

for items of only one type:
\describe{
\item{\code{final_NMI}, \code{initial_NMI}, \code{embeddings}, \code{EGA.model_selected}, \code{final_items},
\code{final_EGA}, \code{initial_EGA}, \code{start_N}, \code{final_N}, \code{network_plot}}{Same as overall object}

\code{initial_boot_with_redundancies} (boot EGA object for original item pool)}
\item{\code{stability_plot}}{ggplot/patchwork stability plot showing item stability before vs after reduction}
}
}
}}
}
\description{
GENIE applies the psychometric reduction steps present in \code{AIGENIE} on user-supplied
items. Users provide their own items and optionally their own
embeddings, then \code{GENIE} performs redundancy reduction and
structural validation to assess item quality and dimensionality.
